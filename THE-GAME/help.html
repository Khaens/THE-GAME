    <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
    <p>Work together to play all cards from the deck and your very own hands onto the four piles before running out of moves!</p>
   
    <h2>SETUP</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Players:</b> 2-5 players (cooperative game)</li>
        <li><b>Starting Hand:</b> Each player receives 6 cards</li>
        <li><b>Four Piles:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>2 <span class="green">Ascending Piles</span> (start at 1, go up)</li>
                <li>2 <span class="orange">Descending Piles</span> (start at 100, go down)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>
    
    <h3>On Your Turn:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Play at least 2 cards</b> from your hand onto any of the four piles</li>
        <li>If there are no more cards that can be drawn, only a minimum of 1 card is to be played</li>
        <li>After playing, draw back to 6 cards (if deck has cards)</li>
        <li>Pass the turn to the next player</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Card Placement Rules:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="green">Ascending Piles:</span> Play higher numbers (e.g., 1 → 15 → 28 → 45...)</li>
        <li><span class="orange">Descending Piles:</span> Play lower numbers (e.g., 100 → 82 → 67 → 43...)</li>
        <li><span class="purple">Special Rule - Backward Trick:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>You can go <i>backwards by exactly 10</i> on ascending piles</li>
                <li>You can go <i>forwards by exactly 10</i> on descending piles</li>
                <li>Example: 45 → <b>35</b> on ascending or 55 → <b>65</b> on descending</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Communication Rules:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Cannot</b> say specific card numbers</li>
        <li><b>Can</b> give hints like "I have very high cards" or "I can help with the descending pile"</li>
        <li><b>Can</b> discuss strategy generally</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>WINNING & LOSING</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="green">You WIN</span> if all cards from both the players' hands and the main deck are onto the piles</li>
        <li><span class="red">You LOSE</span> if a player cannot play the minimum cards required</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>TIPS FOR SUCCESS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Communicate constantly</b> - teamwork is essential!</li>
        <li><b>Save the "backward trick"</b> for emergencies</li>
        <li><b>Spread cards across all piles</b> - don't focus on just one</li>
        <li><b>Middle-range cards (40-60)</b> are the hardest to play - use them wisely!</li>
        <li><b>Plan ahead</b> - think about what cards teammates might need</li>
    </ul>
